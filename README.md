# Github api coding challenge by Mohamed Elsayed

This project was created for the gemography front-end coding challenge

## What I used
HTML5 - Javascript - CSS3 - jQuery library.

## How it works

It uses jQuery to send ajax call to the github API, then generates the repo list 30 at a time, then as you scroll more repos will load in.

## How to start it

All you need to do is open the index.html, as simple as that!
